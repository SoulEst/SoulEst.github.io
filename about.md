My mind never stops, especially my imagination. I take my memories of previous ideas and topics I've read or heard about and use them to solve the various problems I've come across in my own life and the lives of others.

From as far back as I can remember, I was always interested in automotive design and computer technology. To further my curiousity driven ventures, I starting blogging. Every article I post tells a story or contains 
information that others have found relevant.
