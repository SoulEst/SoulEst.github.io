Yesterday was the first day of my third semester in the [Computer Engineering
program][1]. In preparation for it, I started work on a computing setup inspired by
one that I had completed back when I was in [university][2]. I had started the project 
with the intention of recreating this

setup that I had back in university years ago. After working on a part of the
computing setup, I took a break and proceeding to watch a few videos from the
[XCARFilms channel on YouTube][3]. I then came across their [interview with Charles
Morgan in regards to the Morgan AeroMax][4]. During that interview, Charles
quoted a phrase from the Chairman of Cartier University. The phrase went like
this:

"You can never repeat the past; but you can always be inspired by it."

That quote opened my eyes as to what I had been doing wrong for a very long
time: trying to recreate specific objects or events from my past. That cannot
be done. I can however be inspired by them, and use that inspiration when
creating new objects or in experiencing new events.

After much planning, soldering, building, installation, and setup, I finally
came up with this

![Alt ""][6]

computing setup which includes (from left to right), a DIY iMac, an IBM G78 CRT
monitor (connected to a custom built workstation), and a ThinkPad X200s. 

The custom workstation contains the following parts:

<table>
    <tr><td>Motherbard</td><td>ASUS P5LD2-VM</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Processor</td><td>Intel Core 2 Duo E6300 @ 2 GHz</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Memory</td><td>3 GB DDR2-572</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Video Card</td><td>Nvidia GeForce 9500 GT 1 GB</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Video Drivers</td><td>Nvidia Drivers </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Solid State Drive</td><td>Mushkin Chronos Deluxe 60 GB (MLC)</td></tr>
    <tr><td rowspan="2">Hard Drives</td><td>Hitachi HTS723216L</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Toshiba MQ01ABD100</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Optical Drive</td><td>LITE-ON DH-16A1L</td></tr>
</table>

The DIY iMac, custom workstation and ThinkPad all run Arch Linux. It's not much
now, but once I've replaced the keyboard and mouse for the workstation and
replaced to hard drive with a solid state drive in the DIY iMac, everything
will be complete.
